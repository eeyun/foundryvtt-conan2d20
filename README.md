# Robert E. Howard's Conan (2D20)

Robert E. Howard's Conan is based on the 2D20 cinematic system developped by Modiphius Entertainment (https://www.modiphius.net/) through their kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/robert-e-howards-conan-roleplaying-game).

Community contributed system for the Foundry VTT (https://foundryvtt.com/). MOST of this project has been very heavily influenced by [Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2E](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e) from actual blobs of code to the repository layout and project organization. All credit to their previous work and generosity. 

## Installation Instructions

In the setup page of your Foundry VTT installation, when running on your own computer (i.e. self hosted) it should be available at http://localhost:30000/setup.

Go into the **Game Systems** sections and click on the **Install System** button at the bottom left.

You can either search for the System under **Robert E. Howard's CONAN (2D20)** in the list available or directly request an installation from Gitlab at https://gitlab.com/kayhos/foundryvtt-conan2d20/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/system.json?job=build

### Code Contributions

@Hooking was generous enough to let us reuse the item selector from his game system [Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2e (PF2e)](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e). That piece of code was contributed by `an unkown contributor` on the PF2e game system.
