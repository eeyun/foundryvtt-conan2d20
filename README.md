# Work In Progress
# Robert E. Howard's Conan (2D20)

Community contributed (WIP) system for the Foundry VTT (https://foundryvtt.com/) based on the BoilerPlate system by asacolips (Discord: asacolips#1867).

Robert E. Howard's Conan is based on the 2D20 cinematic system developped by Modiphius Entertainment (https://www.modiphius.net/) through their kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/robert-e-howards-conan-roleplaying-game).
