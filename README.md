# Robert E. Howard's Conan (2D20) ~ Work In Progress

Community contributed (WIP) system for the Foundry VTT (https://foundryvtt.com/) based on the BoilerPlate system by asacolips (Discord: asacolips#1867).

Robert E. Howard's Conan is based on the 2D20 cinematic system developped by Modiphius Entertainment (https://www.modiphius.net/) through their kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/robert-e-howards-conan-roleplaying-game).

## Installation Instructions

To install the Conan 2D20 system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, simply paste the following URL into the **Install System** dialog on the Setup menu of the application. 

https://github.com/jeromelavoie/foundryvtt-conan2d20/raw/master/system.json

If you wish to manually install the system, you must clone or extract it into the `foundrydata` under `systems\conan2d20`, commonly ``Data/systems/conan2d20``. You may do this by cloning the repository or downloading a zip archive from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/jeromelavoie/foundryvtt-conan2d20/).

You can find out where the `foundrydata` folder is located in the Configuration and Setup page under the Configuration tab (next to the Update Software tab).

## Code contributions

@Hooking was generous enough to let us reuse the item selector from his game system [Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2e (PF2e)](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e). That piece of code was contributed by `unknown as of now` on the PF2e game system.
