If no d6 were rolled, the cause of the Burning effect will list a duration. At the end of the target's turn, the target suffers X d6 physical and mental damage (roll once, apply for both), ignoring Armor Soak. Any physical damage caused by Burning X has the Incendiary attack Quality, and Effects rolled increase the number of rounds that the character remains aflame. A character may attempt a Clear Minor Action to remove this effect, while a prone character can spend a Standard Action rolling around, extinguishing the flames. The latter works as a Clear Action but reduces the Difficulty by two steps. If the character is hit by another Burning attack or effect while already ablaze, the existing status is extended by a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled.",

Further, the character may only move to within Close range as a Minor Action move, and only to within Medium range as a Standard Action move. Finally, the Difficulty of all terrain tests is increased by one step for the character.",

An ensnared target is unable to move or take action except to attempt an Acrobatics or Athletics test with a Difficulty equal to the number of Effects rolled. Against an ensnared target, the Difficulty of the Exploit Action is reduced by one step. If the Grappling weapon is a melee weapon, the wielder may not attack with the weapon against anyone else while the target is ensnared.

This costs two Momentum for attacks with Hidden 1 or Hidden 2, and 1 point of Momentum for attacks with Hidden 3 or higher. This is used when the weapon is concealed, not when it is in use.",

When damage is rolled with this weapon, it does not score damage when an Effect is rolled. It is possible for an item to have both the Improvised and Vicious Qualities, cancelling out their effects, but both will be noted in case some factor causes the attack to increase its Vicious Quality, or to lose Improvised.",

At the end of each of the target's turns, the target suffers X d6 physical damage to a random hit location and suffers the same amount of mental damage (roll once for both). Damage inflicted by Incendiary X ignores Soak. Any Effects rolled on this additional damage increase the number of rounds that the character is aflame, though a character can attempt to remove this condition early as normal.",

        "qualitiesDescriptionNonl": "The attack doesn't inflict lasting damage, instead inflicting a temporary penalty. The attack cannot inflict a normal Harm effect, but rather may only inflict temporary conditions. If the attack has no other Qualities that inflict an alternate Harm, then it inflicts the Dazed Condition until the end of the target's next turn.",

        "qualitiesDescriptionPers": "The attack has a lingering, deleterious effect. If one or more Effects are rolled, the target will suffer X d6 damage at the start of each subsequent turn for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled. Each effect rolled on the ongoing damage adds one additional round of duration. This condition can be avoided entirely at the time it is inflicted by adding a number of points to Doom equal to the number of Effects rolled; after this, it can only be removed by waiting for the duration to end or by taking the Clear action.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionPier": "This attack ignores X points of the target's total Soak for each Effect rolled.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionShie": "Shields are extremely effective at affording protection from a range of different attacks. A shield counts as having the Parrying Quality. A shield also allows the wielder to use the Parry skill to make Defend Reactions against ranged attacks in addition to Melee attacks. Further if the Wielder has Guard, a shield grants the wielder X d6 Cover Soak against Melee and Ranged attacks. Finally, shields may be sacrificed in order to avoid suffering a Wound.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionSpre": "This weapon is designed to affect a larger area. For each Effect generated, roll X additional hit locations. These additional hit locations suffer half of the attack's final damage, rounding up. In the case of non-player characters or beings where hit locations are not being used, the target takes the additional damage X times.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionStun": "The attack inflicts the Staggered condition on the target, if one or more Effects are rolled. The condition lasts until the end of the target's next turn. The target may ignore this at the cost of 1 point of Doom for each Effect rolled.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionSubt": "The attack is particularly quiet and draws little attention. Any Observation test to detect an attack with this weapon increases in DIfficulty by a number of steps equal to X. This differs from the Hidden Quality in that it is used when the weapon is used, versus when it is concealed.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionThro": "The weapon can be thrown effectively. When throwing a melee weapon with the Thrown Quality, your character does not increase the Difficulty of the Ranged Weapons test. Some weapons may be listed as Thrown (M), in which case they are traeted as ranged weapons with a range of Medium when thrown.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionUnfo": "If the target of this attack was affected by an Exploit action immediately before this attack was made, then this attack gains the Intense and Vicious X Qualities.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionVici": "An attack with this Quality inflicts X additional damage for each Effect rolled.",
        "qualitiesDescriptionVoll": "This ranged weapon can be used quickly, allowing the wielder to unleash volleys of projectiles. Thus, wielders often carry bundles of ammunition. An attack with a Volley weapon does not expend any Shots; the user has enough ammunition to last the fight, barring Complications. Further, a Load of ammunition can be spent to perform a Volley, adding a bonus d20 to Ranged Weapons tests to attack, and +1 to the weapon's damage if the attack hits. Loads may also be lost as the result of a Complication. After a fight, spent Loads can be recovered in the same way as Shots.",
